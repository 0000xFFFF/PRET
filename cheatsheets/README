Ghostscript Cheatsheet
----------------------

The ghostscript-* cheatsheets can be used to pentest online image converters,
thumbnail previews, print servers or desktop software that deals with images
or PostScript input. If the files are not accepted in web applications, try:

- Try renaming the file extension to, for example, .png before uploading it
- Try renaming the file extension to .pdf (on some sites you need to add an
  invalid header -- "%PDF" -- prepended as first line to fool magic checks)

If processed, The cheatsheets will automatically check for various features,
misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in the PostScript language and certain
versions of the Ghostscript implementation. For a quick test of your system,
simply open the file with a PostScript viewer like evince(1).
